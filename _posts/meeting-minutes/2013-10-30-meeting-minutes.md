Administrative Matters:
  - We are going to hold more "Work Days" or "Work Nights"
    - We had planned to do them Wednesdays after meetings, but that doesn't work for anyone...
    - The idea is for people to gather and work on projects, both ongoing and spur-of-the-moment
    - Think of it as an informal, very open-ended hackathon
    - Days being suggested:  Mondays?
  - We have a mailing list!  We encourage you to subscribe if you're interested in hearing about projects
  - The ceiling has been leaking again...
    - If you're here and see it leaking, please contact BU facilities
    - But, we should be good for the rest of the semester, we think
