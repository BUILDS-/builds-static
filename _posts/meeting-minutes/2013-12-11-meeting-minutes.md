Other Opportunities:
  - Supercomputing Club
    - The team is basically all graduating, so they need new members
    - You get to play with really, really, really up-to-date, expensive hardware!
    - Get to go to SC, a supercomputing conference
    - The team works with excellent mentors too

Administrative Matters:
  - No meetings until January.  Have a great break!
  - Website
    - Currently Chris (cwoodall@bu.edu) has been maintaining our website (builds.cc)
    - He's graduating... so someone needs to learn how it works before then
    - Check it out on github, at git://github.com/cwoodall/builds-static

Final Comments:
  - BUILDS is doing great right now!
  - Please always feel free to show off cool things you've been doing
    - We know you've been doing them!
  - Especially think about things you can show at the BUILDS Open House
    - Lots of professors will be there, and they LOVE cool projects
