    - We get a cut
  - Design?
    - BUILDS logo on a white background?
    - Black background looks bad, but black shirts are awesome
    - Talk to Chris if you have ideas

In general, these hack night meetings will be SHORT: about 10 minutes.
(This one went a bit long...)

Projects that people are working on here, tonight
  - Allan:  Genome data analysis/display
    - Take the text output from a commercial service
    - Analyze the genes in it, without sending all your genetic data to "the cloud"
  - Chris and Nate:  3x3 LED panel for ceiling tile
    - RGB LED strips
    - Some assembly required
    - Arduino controlled, so some software work also needed

Future work that's happening
  - Kenshin's AI/Machine Learning group
    - Meeting at Fridays at 3 probably
