On Friday, September 27, 2013 BUILDS hosted a Intro to Git and Github workshop run by 
Christopher Woodall and aided by Danny Cooper, Allan Wirth and George Silvis, III. About
15 people came to BUILDS in MCS B26 to learn about git, how we use git and how to use github.
The focus of the content was to walk through some demos and get the students familiar with
a git workflow and version control.  The [slides](https://github.com/BUILDS-/builds-workshops/tree/master/2013-09-27-intro-to-git) are  available on the 
[BUILDS Workshops Github Repository](https://github.com/BUILDS-/builds-workshops/).

The students created their own github accounts and repository on it. Then they all forked
[a git repo](https://github.com/BUILDS-/git-tutorial-demo), added a file, commited and pushed it
to their github account and then  submitted a pull request. This repository will be used in future
Intro to Git workshops.
