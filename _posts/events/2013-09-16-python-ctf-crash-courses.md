On September 13th and September 14th BUILDS hosted two introductory seminars:
Intro to Python/Unix and Intro to CTF. The seminars were designed to go 
together with the intent of introducing new members to programming, and working
in a unix environment so that they can participate in the upcoming 
[Cyber Security Awareness Week (CSAW)](https://csaw.isis.poly.edu/) capture the
flag (CTF) competition running from September 19th to September 22nd. 

On [CTFtime.org](https://ctftime.org), a website dedicated to tracking teams
and their performance in various CTF events, 
[BUILDS](https://ctftime.org/team/1688) is currently ranked 171 and our 
associated team [BostonKeyParty](https://ctftime.org/team/3600) is currently 
ranked 121.
