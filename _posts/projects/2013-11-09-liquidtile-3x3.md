LiquidTile is an on going project by a collection of BUILDS members including, but not limited to: Christopher Woodall, 
William Gullotta, Nathan Hepler and Danny Cooper. The goal of the LiquidTile project is to make RGB LED lighting tiles
with a software interface for computer control. The current version is a 3x3 RGB LED tile and a video is available
[here][video].

The project source is available on [Github][github] and we are currently working on an 8x8 system.
