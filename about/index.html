### Who We Are
We are a inclusive group of students, artists, hackers, and organizers that believe strongly in experimental learning and the Do-It-Yourself ethic. We facilitate student-led technology initiatives and encourage hands-on learning by maintaining an open workshop and creative space that is freely available to all students. We maintain an inclusive membership policy, and strive to apply the principles of the open-software and open-hardware movements within our design policies. In short, we are an immersive experiment into the hacker ethic.

### Location & Hours
We are located in the basement of the Math and Computer Science building at Boston University, room B28. We are accessible 24/7 to cardholding members, and are available by appointment to non-members. Please e-mail acm@bu.edu to schedule a meeting with us.

### Want to be a Member?
You can join us by e-mailing acm@bu.edu and expressing your interest. Please include your name, university affiliation (if any), and an e-mail address where we can reach you.
